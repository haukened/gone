      <h2 class="underline">What is Gone?</h2>
			<p class="indent"> Go + One = <strong>Gone</strong></p>
      <p class="indent">
				Gone is a tool for sharing secrets privately, readable only one time.
      	The server component is written in <a target="_blank" href="https://golang.org">Golang</a>, a language designed for simplicity and efficiency by Google.
				The client-side application is built with vanilla JavaScript and modern WebCrypto APIs to perform encryption and decryption directly in your browser.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				Gone is open source software. The source code is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/haukened/gone">GitHub</a> under the GNU Affero GPL v3.

			<h2 class="underline">What encryption does Gone use?</h2>
			<p class="indent">Gone uses AES-256-GCM provided by WebCrypto APIs for client-side encryption, which is the same encryption trusted by banks, governments, and security-conscious organizations worldwide.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="card">
			<h2 class="underline">How Gone Keeps Secrets Secret</h2>
			<p class="indent">Gone is designed so the server never learns your secret. The critical cryptography happens entirely in your browser before anything is sent over the network.</p>
			<h3 class="underline">High Level Flow</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>You type a secret</strong> into the form. Before it leaves your device, the browser generates a fresh, random encryption key.</li>
				<li><strong>Client-side encryption</strong> (using modern WebCrypto primitives) transforms the plaintext into an opaque blob.</li>
				<li><strong>Only the encrypted blob</strong> is sent to the Gone server. The key never leaves the browser.</li>
				<li><strong>The server stores</strong> just that blob plus minimal metadata (TTL & one-time marker).</li>
				<li><strong>A shareable URL</strong> is produced. The secret key is embedded in the URL fragment (the part after <code>#</code>) or query component so the server still never sees it during retrieval.</li>
				<li><strong>The recipient loads the URL</strong>; their browser extracts the key locally and fetches the encrypted blob.</li>
				<li><strong>Decryption happens client-side</strong>; the server remains blind to the plaintext the entire time.</li>
				<li><strong>One-time consumption</strong>: after first successful retrieval the stored blob is deleted, preventing reuse.</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section class="card">
			<h3 class="underline">Why This Matters</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Zero server knowledge:</strong> Compromise of the storage tier yields only ciphertext.</li>
				<li><strong>Ephemeral access:</strong> One-time retrieval shrinks the attack window.</li>
				<li><strong>Short TTLs:</strong> Automatic expiry further limits exposure if a link lingers.</li>
				<li><strong>No password reuse risk:</strong> You never transmit existing credentials in the clear.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section class="card">
			<h3 class="underline">Threat Model Notes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Always verify you are on HTTPS (the app warns if not).</li>
				<li>The secrecy guarantee assumes the sender's and recipient's browsers are not compromised.</li>
				<li>Anyone who obtains the full share URL (including its key component) can decrypt the secret until first read or expiry.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="underline">What is the GNU Affero GPL v3, and what does it mean for users?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>For people who simply use Gone, but aren't hosting their own instance, you have no obligations.</strong></li>
				<li>For people who modify Gone and host their own instance, you must share your changes.</li>
				<li>The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</li>
				<li>It is similar to the GNU General Public License (GPL), but with an additional requirement that if you run a modified program on a server and let other users interact with it there, your server must also allow them to download the source code corresponding to the modified version running there.</li>
				<li>This ensures that users who interact with the software over a network have access to its source code, promoting transparency and collaboration.</li>
				<li>It also ensures that for-profit companies that use the software must also share their modifications with the community, improving the software for everyone not just shareholders.</li>
				<li>For more information, or to view the full text of the license, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">GNU website</a>.</li>
