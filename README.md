# gone

Go + One = Gone.  Written in Go, there until its __*gone*__.

## Purpose
Gone is a minimal Go service designed for one-time secret sharing. It enables users to securely share sensitive information by ensuring that secrets are encrypted client-side, transmitted safely, and can only be accessed once before being permanently deleted.

## Security Model
Gone prioritizes security through simplicity and strong encryption practices. Secrets are encrypted on the client side, meaning the service never sees the unencrypted data. Each secret can only be read once, preventing unauthorized access or reuse. This one-time read mechanism, combined with the absence of server-side encryption keys, ensures that secrets remain confidential and ephemeral.

## How It Works
1. The client encrypts the message locally before sending it to the Gone service using AES-GCM with the Web Crypto API.
2. The client sends the encrypted message (but not the decryption key) to the Gone service for temporary storage.
3. The client gives the decryption key to the user, embedded in the URL fragment.
4. When the recipient accesses the secret link, the encrypted data is retrieved and returned to the client, still encrypted.
5. After the secret is accessed once, it is immediately deleted from the server, making it inaccessible thereafter.
6. The client decrypts the message locally in the browser using the passphrase included in the URL fragment (not sent to the server).
7. The server never has access to the plaintext message or any encryption keys, and therefore cannot decrypt the data.

This straightforward design guarantees secure, ephemeral message sharing without the complexity of managing server-side encryption keys or persistent storage.

## Deployment
Gone is designed to be deployed in Docker. It does not accept command line arguments or config files. Instead, it is configured entirely through environment variables.

## Configuration
Gone can be configured using the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable    | Description                                                                   | Default Value            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `GONE_ADDR`             | The address the service listens on.                                           | `:8080`                  |
| `GONE_DATA_DIR`         | The directory where secrets are stored.                                       | `/data`                  |
| `GONE_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` | Maximum size of a secret to be stored inline in sqlite3 (bytes).              | `8192` (8 KiB)           |
| `GONE_MAX_BYTES`        | Maximum size of a secret (bytes).                                             | `1048576` (1 MiB)        |
| `GONE_TTL_OPTIONS`      | Time-to-live options for a secret.                                            | `5m,30m,1h,2h,4h,8h,24h` |
| `GONE_METRICS_ADDR`     | Optional separate listener (e.g. `127.0.0.1:9090`) for JSON metrics. Empty disables. | (empty)                  |
| `GONE_METRICS_TOKEN`    | Optional bearer token required for metrics requests.                          | (empty)                  |

`GONE_TTL_OPTIONS` must be a comma-separated list of valid Go duration strings using only seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h) units (examples: `30s`, `5m`, `1h30m`). The smallest and largest provided durations become the enforced MinTTL and MaxTTL bounds respectively.

`GONE_MAX_BYTES` can be calculated as `1024 * 1024` for 1 MiB, `1024 * 10` for 10 KiB, etc. `1024` bytes is `1KiB`, `1024 * 1024` bytes is `1MiB`, `1024 * 1024 * 1024` bytes is `1GiB`, and so on.

Any requested TTL within the inclusive min/max range is accepted even if it is not explicitly listed in `GONE_TTL_OPTIONS`. The configured list powers the UI dropdown and defines the bounds; it does not constrain valid intermediate durations.

## Metrics (Optional)

Metrics are persisted to SQLite and can be exposed via a separate listener if `GONE_METRICS_ADDR` is set. By default no metrics endpoint is served. If `GONE_METRICS_TOKEN` is set, clients must supply:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### JSON Format
`GET /` on the metrics listener returns:

```json
{
	"counters": {
		"secrets_created_total": 123,
		"secrets_consumed_total": 118,
		"secrets_expired_deleted_total": 47
	},
	"summaries": {
		"janitor_deleted_per_cycle": {
			"count": 42,
			"sum": 420,
			"min": 1,
			"max": 25
		}
	}
}
```

All values are 64-bit integers. Summaries expose aggregated count/sum/min/max across persisted and in-memory (unflushed) observations.

### Metric Definitions
| Name | Type | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| `secrets_created_total` | counter | Number of secrets successfully stored |
| `secrets_consumed_total` | counter | Number of secrets successfully consumed (and deleted) |
| `secrets_expired_deleted_total` | counter | Expired secrets removed by the janitor |
| `janitor_deleted_per_cycle` | summary (count,sum,min,max) | Distribution of expired deletions per janitor cycle |

### Security Note
Do not expose the metrics listener publicly without a reverse proxy / firewall. Even aggregate counters can leak operational patterns. Binding to `127.0.0.1` and scraping locally is recommended for most deployments.

## Storage & Persistence
Gone stores metadata (IDs, expirations, consumed state) in SQLite (WAL mode enforced) and larger ciphertext blobs on the filesystem under `GONE_DATA_DIR` (subdirectory `blobs/`). Inline ciphertext below `GONE_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` is stored directly in SQLite to reduce filesystem churn.

## Quick Start (Docker)
Pull and run the latest image, mounting a data directory:

```sh
docker run --rm \
	-p 8080:8080 \
	-e GONE_DATA_DIR=/data \
	-e GONE_TTL_OPTIONS="5m,30m,1h,2h,4h" \
	-v $(pwd)/data:/data \
	ghcr.io/haukened/gone:latest
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8080/

## Build & Run (Local)

```sh
go build ./cmd/gone && ./gone
```

Environment overrides example:
```sh
GONE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080 \
GONE_DATA_DIR=$(pwd)/data \
GONE_TTL_OPTIONS="5m,30m,1h" \
GONE_MAX_BYTES=$((1024*1024)) \
GONE_METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9090 \
GONE_METRICS_TOKEN=localtok \
go run ./cmd/gone
```

## Security Headers
The server sets security-focused headers (see middleware) including:
* `Cache-Control: no-store`
* `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
* `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
* `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
* `Content-Security-Policy` (planned explicit enumeration)

## Roadmap (Excerpt)
* Rate limiting / abuse guard
* Optional Prometheus exposition
* CSP tightening & documentation
* Graceful shutdown coordination improvements
